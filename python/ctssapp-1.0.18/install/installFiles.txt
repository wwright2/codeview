# Enter the names of files here that need to be included in the new
# release. These are files that are to be replaced in the root file
# system, for example, a new version of /etc/rc.local
#
# ..Works like a copy command cp src dest.
#   source destination
# 
# ..We expect source to be relative to this Dir CTSS

#          |-buildroot
#
# The first field of each line is the name of the file to be
# installed, with the path relative to the ctss directory. The second
# field is the full path to the file on the target file system, eg,
# /etc
#
# for example, if a filename starts with a directory immediatly under
# ctss, do not give any leading path, eg
#
#    system/foo.sh
#
# If a filename starts with a directory above ctss, give the relative
# path starting from ctss. For exaple, if a file under buildroot is
# wanted (which is at the same level as ctss), do
#
#   ../buildroot/buildroot-2011.05/scripts/post/doUpdate.sh
#
# No extraction from svn is done. What is on disk at the point this is
# run is what will go into the load.
# 
# the buildroot directory is a special case. The version can't be
# predicted, so just use the string BUILDROOT, and it will be replaced
# as needed. This depends on BUILDROOT_VER begin set in make.conf
#
# example
#BUILDROOT/buildroot-2011.05/output/target/usr/bin/updateStatus.sh /usr/bin

/lib/libctss.so /usr/lib
