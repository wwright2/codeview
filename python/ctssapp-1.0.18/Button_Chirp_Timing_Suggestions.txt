New Configuration Parameters - These parameters will be added to the file tracker.conf:

- Day Time Button Chirp Volume (1 - 9)
- Night Time Button Chirp Volume (1 - 9)
- Day Time Volume Switch Over Time - (Time format readable by both human & program)
- Night Time Volume Switch Over Time - (Time format readable by both human & program)
- Button Chirp Active Time - in seconds.
  Chirp volume set to volume setting based on day or night period.
  (Since chirp is performed ~once a second by the hardware,
  a one second time may need to be a little longer than a second
  in order to insure that at least one chirp is heard)
- Button Chirp Quiet Time - in seconds.

Tasks:

1 - Define new configuration parameters.  See Above.
2 - Implement Chirp On/Off duration operation as part of timer_handler() (in buttonmon.c) BSM_idle state.
    Any other state will quiet the Chirp.
    May need to change timer duration to allow for Chirp hardware timing support.
    It may be possible to implement this functionality into the buttonMonitor() Thread.
3 - Add test to determine when to change Chirp Volume - day verses night.
4 - Add code in start up to determine which volume level is currently active - day verses night.
5 - Change ttsStop() (in tts.c) to use current Chirp volume or remove setButtonVolume() call
    to allow the BSM_idle state in timer_handler() to handle the Chirp.
